# Mini-Project
Backend for a cafe application, with command line interaction.
# How it Functions?

## app.py
- Hard-code the products and product menu options in lists.
- Contains methods to get user's choice from either menu, and  user's choice of product after displaying them.
- Depending on user input, the app either exits or goes to product menu from the main menu.
- At the product menu, the user either returns to the main menu, sees the list of products, or adds / updates / deletes a product.
- Return to the main menu after using the product menu once.

## logo.py
- Currently contain's the logo for this terminal-based application, which shall appear at the top of the visible terminal.
