# Mini-Project

How it functions?
In app.py we are storing the products and product menu options in lists. There are methods to get user's choice from both the main menu and the product menu. There is a method to get user's choice of product after displaying them. Depending on user input, the app either exits or goes to product menu from the main menu. At the product menu, the user either returns to the main menu, sees the list of products, or adds/updates/deletes a product. After using the product menu, the user returns to the main menu (this will change later on).

Week 1 Requirements:
Create a list of products, view all products, and be able to update/delete a product.
This updated list will initially not be stored.
