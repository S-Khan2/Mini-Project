# Mini-Project

This is the main branch of the mini project. Here I will commit changes only if I am certain that this is the way to move forward. When new weekly requirements are presented, I will create a separate branch for those purposes. The initial additions to this branch will be the directory structure.

Week 1 Requirements:
Create a list of products, view all products, and be able to update/delete a product.
This updated list will initially not be stored.
